    review: 'The Saddleback displays a wonderful range of colors and textures, all of them appealing. Although the moth is native to eastern North America, it has a distinctively southwestern vibe. The design on this caterpillar back would make a beautiful bedspread. I long to ride this caterpillar in a parade.',

    review: 'This caterpillar looks like a pine forest recently charred in a wildfire. I admire the Flambeau, but prefer to do so from afar. If I were a bird, I would not try to eat this caterpillar. The Flambeau appeals to something vague but powerful within me; I am not sure what.',

    review: 'The Swordgrass, seen here sleeping, spends most of its time in the form of a perfect golden spiral. The moth can be found all across Eurasia. The golden line running alongside its body is thought to be origin of the term "Golden Spiral." I can use this caterpillar as a reference on my Math exam.',
